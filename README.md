# Scanning-and-Parsing-using-Lex-and-Yacc
The Lex tool is used for writing the scanner and the Yacc tool is used to generate the parser for a programming language called "MyLang". The details of the language are noted in the file "Project.pdf".

To run the program you need to:
- Open the terminal at the program folder
- Write "yacc -d phase2.y" in the terminal
- Write "flex phase2.l" in the terminal
- Write "gcc phase2.tab.c lex.yy.c -ly -ll" in the terminal
- Write "./a.out" in the terminal then enter your desired expression
